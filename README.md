### Week 4 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview
A project using loops, logic, classes, and creativity to write a Blackjack game in Java code. 

### Technologies Used
Git, Eclipse, Java, loops, classes, object orientated programming. 

### How to Run
Easy play, asks if you want to deal again or quit, allow user the option to hit or stay.

### Lessons Learned
In working with classes and object oriented programming I feel like I have been reaching around in a dark room, after 4 weeks of Java and doing this project I feel like the lights have finally been turned on, maybe not full on, but getting clearer.
